* What did you learn yesterday/this week?
  I learned about the Rabin-Karp Algorithm. The Rabin-Karp Algorithm is a string matching algorithm used to find pattern within a large text. it is particulalry useful when searching multiple patterns simultaneously. The algorithm works by using a rolling hash function to efficiently compare the hash values of the pattern and substrings of the text. If the hash values match, it performs a full comparison of the pattern and substrings of the text. It has several advantages that make it a valuable tool in many practical applications such as text editors and search engines hightlight keywords and plagiarism detection. Its disadvantange is to able to have the worst time complexity when frequent hash collisions occur. The complexity can go to O(M*N).
In general, the space complexity is O(1).
In general, the time complexity is O(N+N).

* What excites or interests you about coding?
    My wife excels at manintaining focus during simple, repetitive tasks, while i tend to concentrate best when engaging in new task or leaning new things. This is why i like coding. Living in 2024, everything around us is accelerating and updating due to advancements such as AI. Development, in particular, is rapidly evolving. As languages, libraries, and frameworks grow and update at an exponential rate, we must update our code to keep pace, and at times, learn and apply new techs. Personally, I view this trend of constant learning and adaptation positively, which makes coding suited to my interests and engaging for me.
